# Product Context: Joy-Con ESP32 Interface

## Purpose

The Joy-Con ESP32 Interface project exists to bridge the gap between Nintendo's Joy-Con controllers and custom ESP32-based projects. By providing a reliable and comprehensive interface, it enables makers to leverage the ergonomic design and features of Joy-Con controllers in their own creations.

## Problem Space

### Problems Solved

1. **Hardware Integration**
   - Complex Bluetooth communication with Joy-Con controllers
   - Calibration and drift compensation for analog inputs
   - Handling of multiple controller connections

2. **Development Complexity**
   - Simplified API for reading controller inputs
   - Pre-built button mapping and event handling
   - Ready-to-use movement detection and intensity calculations

3. **Technical Barriers**
   - Abstraction of low-level Bluetooth protocols
   - Management of controller pairing and reconnection
   - Handling of controller-specific quirks
