# Project Brief: Joy-Con ESP32 Interface

## Overview

The Joy-Con ESP32 Interface project aims to create a robust interface between Nintendo Joy-Con controllers and ESP32 microcontrollers, enabling makers and developers to use Joy-Cons in custom projects.

## Core Requirements

1. Controller Interface
   - Connect and manage Nintendo Joy-Con controllers via Bluetooth
   - Support multiple controllers simultaneously (up to BP32_MAX_GAMEPADS)
   - Handle controller connection/disconnection events gracefully

2. Input Handling
   - Map all Joy-Con buttons including:
     - Standard buttons (A, B, X, Y)
     - D-pad (Up, Down, Left, Right)
     - Special buttons (SL, SR, R, ZR)
     - System buttons (Home, Plus)
     - Thumbstick button
   - Process analog stick inputs with:
     - Calibration support
     - Deadzone handling
     - Diagonal movement detection
     - Movement intensity calculation

3. Technical Requirements
   - Use Bluepad32 library for controller communication
   - Implement proper calibration for analog inputs
   - Handle controller reconnection scenarios
   - Provide debugging output via Serial communication

## Project Goals

1. **Accessibility**: Create an easy-to-use interface for Joy-Con controllers
2. **Reliability**: Ensure stable connections and accurate input processing
3. **Flexibility**: Support various use cases through comprehensive input handling
4. **Extensibility**: Allow easy integration into other ESP32 projects

## Target Users

- Makers and hobbyists
- Game developers
- Interactive installation creators
- Educational project developers

## Success Criteria

1. Successful connection and maintenance of Joy-Con controllers
2. Accurate button and analog stick input processing
3. Proper handling of multiple controllers
4. Clear documentation and example implementations
5. Minimal input latency
6. Stable operation without crashes or disconnects

## Constraints

- Limited to ESP32 hardware
- Dependent on Bluepad32 library capabilities
- Bluetooth connectivity limitations
- ESP32 processing and memory constraints

## Out of Scope

- Support for other controller types
- Advanced motion control features
- HD rumble features
- IR camera functionality
- Battery level monitoring
